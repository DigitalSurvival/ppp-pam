=== Leopard ===

It's not known yet whether this works on Leopard.  If you feel daring, follow the instructions below for Tiger and report back with your results.

~~At the moment, the code has only reported to build properly on Intel-based macs.  Support for powerpc macs is planned, however access to a powerpc machine for testing is holding up development.~~

_It's been reported that this now works for powerpc macs as well as Intel._

The code does not yet work under Linux, however, some progress has been made in getting it to compile.  Details can be found in the comments attached to [http://code.google.com/p/ppp-pam/issues/detail?id=4 issue number 4].  This page will be updated once it is confirmed to be working.
